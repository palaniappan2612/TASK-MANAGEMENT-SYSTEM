# TASK-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

I have created a web-based Task Management System that allows users to add, edit, mark as completed, and delete tasks. The application stores tasks in the browser's local storages.

## Features

- **Add** tasks with a name and description.
- **Edit** existing tasks.
- Mark tasks **status** as completed or pending.
- **Delete** tasks.
- **Filter** tasks based on status (All, Pending, Completed).


## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript



## Usage

1. Enter a task name and an optional description.
2. Click the "Add Task" button to add the task.
3. Use the buttons next to each task to:
   - **Mark as completed/pending**
   - **Edit the task name and description**
   - **Delete the task**
4. Use the filter option as dropdown to view All, Pending, or Completed tasks.
